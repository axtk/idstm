*<ins>I</ins>mmutable <ins>d</ins>ata <ins>st</ins>ore with a <ins>m</ins>utable interface for React apps*

## Purpose

Sharing data across React components by means of a single new hook in a fashion similar to the React's `useState()` hook for local state.

## Exports

`Store`, `useStore`.

## Usage

ðŸ”¹ Wrap up shared data into `new Store(data)`, put it into a React Context;

ðŸ”¹ Read and subscribe to updates in the store:
```js
const [state, setState] = useStore(store);
```

Call `useStore(store, false)` to get `[state, setState]` without subscribing to updates in the store.

ðŸ”¹ Update the immutable store state via the mutable interface of `setState()`:
```js
setState(draftState => { draftState.x += 5; });
```

ðŸ”¹ Have as many stores as needed.
