# idstm

*<ins>I</ins>mmutable <ins>d</ins>ata <ins>st</ins>ore with a <ins>m</ins>utable interface for React apps*

## Purpose

Using data shared across React components in a simple way similar to React's `useState()`.

## Usage

ðŸ”¹ Wrap up shared data into `new Store(data)` imported from this package, put it into a React Context;

ðŸ”¹ Read and subscribe to updates in the store:

```js
import {useStore} from 'idstm';

let [state, setState] = useStore(store);
```

Call `useStore(store, false)` to get `[state, setState]` without subscribing to updates in the store.

ðŸ”¹ Update the immutable store state via the mutable interface of `setState()`:

```js
setState(draftState => { draftState.x += 5; });
```

ðŸ”¹ Have as many stores as needed.
